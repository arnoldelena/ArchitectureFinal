Team members:
Elena Arnold
Lucy Liu
Seth Taylor

Proposal:
	I'd like to work with Elena and Lucy to make a processor in verilog that can run multiple instructions in parallel. This would be an extension of projects 8-10, so we would only implement all of the instructions that were given in project 10.
