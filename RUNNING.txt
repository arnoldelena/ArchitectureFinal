Please include clear and simple instructions for running your project.
Our project runs in the same manner as the projects p8-pa. To run, provide a .bin file containing PPC machine language and run with the same run instructions from p8-pa.

Explain why your supplied tests illustrate that your project works
Our project passes hello.bin from p8-pa, which tests the addi and ld instructions.
UPDATE: Our project was tested against and passes the vast majority of student-submitted tests for p8, so it is expected that many edge cases are accounted for. It passes the benchmark tests for p8, such as hello, Souvik's test, etc.
